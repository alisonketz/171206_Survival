\caption{The cumulative weekly probability of surviving from the beginning of the study through the end of the first year for chronic wasting disease negative white-tailed deer, for adult females (blue line) and adult males (orange line). The cumulative weekly survival probability for chronic wasting disease positive deer are lower than for negative deer, for both adult females (pink line) and adult males (solid grey line). Equal-tailed 95 \% Bayesian credible intervals are shown in the corresponding color shaded regions. The bow hunt harvest season begins at the light grey dashed line and continues to the end of the study. The light grey shaded regions with darker grey dashed lines denote the gun harvest seasons.}\label{fig:survival_sex_cwd}
